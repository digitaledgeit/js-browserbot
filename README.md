# browserbot

A library for programatically browsing websites.

Takes many ideas from [NightmareJS](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) with one major difference - errors stop the queued actions from executing.

## Install

    npm install --save browserbot

## TODO:

 - better error handling e.g. when selectors are not found
 - add optional timeouts for wait functions
 - implement unfinished actions
 - use the same debug object
